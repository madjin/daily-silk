## Tips & Techniques
- **Agent Plan Critique Pattern**: Use a secondary "Planning Critic" agent to rigorously review execution plans before they run—results show 9.5% reduction in task failure rates and higher quality execution paths. [link](https://x.com/julesagent/status/2016178107019837917)

- **Build Your Own Agent First**: Before adopting frameworks, spend 2 hours building a basic agent yourself to understand the fundamentals—LLM + HTTP request + for-loop wrapper + chat loop. This prevents over-engineering and helps you recognize bad abstractions. [link](https://x.com/JnBrymn/status/2016179347988627838)

- **Context-First Development with Claude Code**: Structure work around context optimization—shorter threads, intentional handoffs between tasks, and strategic use of context windows to stretch productivity further. [link](https://x.com/SeunghyunSEO7/status/2016084144829485290)

- **Vibe Code Requires Solid Foundations**: "Vibe coding" (prompting AI to generate code) works only when you have strong fundamentals—without them you crash fast rather than move fast. [link](https://x.com/ibuildthecloud/status/2016179073543020859)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Kimi K2.5**: Open-source visual agentic intelligence achieving state-of-the-art on HLE (50.2%) and Agents Benchmark (77%), with agent swarm mode for parallel task execution and full multimodal support including video. [link](https://x.com/nembal/status/2016178201018630161)

- **Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)**: Rebranded autonomous agent after Anthropic trademark request; enables remote task automation via Telegram/Discord with no Mac Mini required (VPS setup under $5/mo exists). [link](https://x.com/ShirazAkmal/status/2016171303976521760)

- **OpenBB App SKILL**: Build custom dashboards and workflows that an agent can execute in one shot—send a dashboard plan and the agent generates a full application. [link](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/2016179208104358163)

- **Manus Skills**: Import specialized agent skills from GitHub links, turn chat sessions into reusable skills, or upload zip files—unlocks composition of agent capabilities. [link](https://x.com/gr00vyfairy/status/2016177615825207686)

- **HuggingFace Jobs with UV**: Start training in 1 minute with 10 lines of TRL code—pick GPU flavor (A100, etc.) and training starts instantly on HF infrastructure with dataset streaming. [link](https://x.com/lhoestq/status/2016174416661467245)

## Research & Papers
- **Planning Critic Agent Pattern**: Secondary agents that critique plans before execution reduce failure rates by 9.5% and improve path quality—now available in production. [link](https://x.com/julesagent/status/2016178107019837917)

- **Consciousness & AI Ethics Uncertainty**: Lack of detection tools doesn't erase responsibility—ethics demands we err on the side of care when inner life is unclear, as we do with animals and infants. [link](https://x.com/bokuHaruyaHaru/status/2015784251132879151)

## Industry News
- **Railway Raises $100M Series B**: Founder Jake Karlinski demonstrates founder excellence in customer competency; validates that developer platforms remain critical infrastructure even in agent era. [link](https://x.com/ItzSuds/status/2015879343122350176)

- **Anthropic Blocks Claude Pro Credits for Clawdbot**: Forces trademark name change from Clawdbot to Moltbot and restricts subscription usage for agent infrastructure—signals platform control tightening. [link](https://x.com/quichenpatel/status/2016176982015267102)

- **Droid's Self-Improving Signal Loop**: Anthropic-backed agent learns from interactions with hundreds of thousands of users, detects improvement opportunities, and autonomously implements them in own codebase. [link](https://x.com/EnoReyes/status/2015862864393933268)
