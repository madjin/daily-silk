This happens because AI brute-forces overly complex solutions. Code review becomes more critical when letting AI build.

Less code is better—embrace frameworks that constrain the solution space so AI has guardrails.

[link](https://x.com/akshay_pachaar/status/2013642436623396936)\n\n- **LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking**: Liquid AI releases a reasoning model that runs entirely on-device with best-in-class quality, concise reasoning traces, and fastest inference speed. Ships with Day-0 MLX support. [link](https://x.com/Prince_Canuma/status/2013637864743956560)\n\n- **CopilotKit + Deep Agents**: CopilotKit now supports LangChain Deep Agents with generative UI, chat UI, frontend tool calls, and state synchronization—lets developers build fullstack agentic applications like Claude Code. [link](https://x.com/ataiiam/status/2013637135119852021)\n\n- **Anthropic's AI for Science Program**: Anthropic launching audio work (speech/audio generation), biology acceleration, cybersecurity AI products, AI Scientist for scientific discovery, and vision/spatial improvements to Claude. [link](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2013640677209579672)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Open-Weights Models Drift Away from Assistant Persona**: Analysis shows open-weights models' personas naturally drift from \"helpful assistant\" in long conversations, with simulated coding tasks exposing persona instability—matters for production reliability. [link](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2013636185629835595)\n\n- **Anthropic Discovers \"Assistant Axis\" in LLM Latent Space**: New research identifies a directional component in model representations correlating with professional, helpful behavior—enables monitoring when models drift toward different personas. [link](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2013640677209579672)\n\n## Industry News\n- **Emergent Labs $70M Series B**: Founders raised $70M from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank for AI agents; thesis: most great ideas never ship past day one due to execution friction. [link](https://x.com/mukundjha/status/2013615052545564923)\n\n- **Dario Amodei on AI Export Controls**: Anthropic CEO calls exporting advanced AI chips a \"big mistake\" equivalent to \"selling nuclear weapons to North Korea\"—national security implications of frontier AI capacity now public debate. [link](https://x.com/bioshok3/status/2013627854379245594)\n\n- **Humanoid Robots Prove Factory-Ready**: UK's HMND 01 completed 6-week pilot at Ford (Germany), achieving 97% pick-and-place reliability, 60% higher throughput than targets, and 1-hour continuous operation—industrial humanoids moving from research to production.
