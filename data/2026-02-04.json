[link](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/2019075781293408285)\n\n- **ElevenLabs Series D at $11B Valuation**: ElevenLabs raised $500M led by Sequoia with a16z quadrupling down, reflecting strong traction in voice AI and enterprise agent platforms. [link](https://x.com/matiii/status/2019048833687126248)\n\n- **Positron Raises $230M Series B for AI Inference Chips**: The customer-led round (Jump Trading co-leading) validates Positron's efficiency-focused inference hardware approach at over $1B valuation. [link](https://x.com/kmett/status/2019077655635562588)\n\n- **Adaption Labs Launches with $50M to Build Adaptable AI Models**: Sarah Hookr's new lab tackles efficiency and adaptability as frontier problems, addressing the gap between one-size-fits-all models and real-world needs. [link](https://x.com/jacobmbuckman/status/2019074964482048404)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n\n- **Planning Before Coding with LLMs Works Better**: Using LLMs to create a plan first rather than jumping into code improves outcomes, especially for complex projects you don't fully understand yet. [link](https://x.com/thdxr/status/2019076536838541728)\n\n- **Safety Layers for AI Agents Managing Real Money**: Seven key safety guardrails (high-frequency+low-risk automation vs. human oversight) and an autonomy matrix prevent disasters when agents handle financial operations. [link](https://x.com/kamilkwapiszpl/status/2019071216582025496)\n\n- **Custom Healthcare RAG Evaluation Beats Generic Metrics**: Standard LLM-as-judge frameworks catch only ~60% of clinical issues; layer custom judges from regulatory docs + citation verification for production medical AI. [link](https://x.com/Ubunta/status/2019078234718322825)\n\n- **Claude Code's Tasks Feature Boosts Productivity**: Breaking work into well-contained tasks with proper dependencies in Claude Code significantly increases output per session, especially for high-effort research. [link](https://x.com/MiguelriosEN/status/2019074167677599749)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n\n- **Kling 3.0 Video Model**: Combines capabilities of 2.6 + reasoning in unified system; available exclusively on fal as an API with native video generation at \"everyone a director\" quality. [link](https://x.com/fal/status/2019072794705932377)\n\n- **Mistral Voxtral Transcribe 2**: Next-gen speech-to-text with speaker diarization and state-of-the-art transcription; useful for meeting recording and call center applications paired with GenAI. [link](https://x.com/sophiamyang/status/2019074470397239440)\n\n- **Intern-S1-Pro: 1T MoE Scientific Reasoning Model**: Open-source multimodal model competitive with GPT-5.2 on AI4Science benchmarks; demonstrates strong performance on chemistry, materials, and biology tasks. [link](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2019076511177781389)\n\n- **PaperBanana: Agentic Framework for Research Illustrations**: Auto-generates NeurIPS-quality diagrams via retrieve→plan→style→render→critique workflow; supports both illustrative diagrams and statistical plots. [link](https://x.com/dwzhu128/status/2018405593976103010)\n\n## Research & Papers\n\n- **Modular Gradient Surgery for Multi-Domain RL**: Resolves gradient conflicts at transformer module level to train general thinking models across Math, Chat, and IF with ~16% relative gains over naive multi-task RL.
