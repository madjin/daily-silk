- **Ask Claude What Context It's Missing**: Simple but powerful technique—directly ask your AI assistant "Are you missing any context?" to surface information gaps before it proceeds with tasks, improving reliability. [link](https://x.com/jeffreyhuber/status/2020524379180818478)

- **Plan Mode Without Most Tools Works Better**: Claude Code's plan mode achieves superior results when constrained from tool use—prevents model drift when tools are available but shouldn't be prioritized. [link](https://x.com/ErdalToprak/status/2020524476799099356)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Node.js Runs Entirely in Browser with Open-Source Library**: Vibe-coded library with full POSIX-compatible filesystem, 40+ shimmed Node modules, real npm package support, and dev server HMR—enables serverless development workflows with no backend needed. [link](https://x.com/PetrBrzek/status/2020161329470828932)

- **Codex 5.3 Launches with 60% Speed Boost**: OpenAI's coding model ships with dramatic performance improvements plus additional 10-20% faster execution for Pro subscribers. Early signals show superior code quality compared to Claude Opus 4.6 but weaker UI/design generation. [link](https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/2020520514469442009)

- **OpenClaw Dominates OpenRouter with 151B Tokens**: Agent client reaches #1 position on OpenRouter, demonstrating shift away from web-only access toward flexible client tooling that lets users choose models per workflow. [link](https://x.com/lucas_flatwhite/status/2020521040829698363)

- **Recursive Language Models (RLMs) Enable 10M+ Token Management**: Google Cloud demonstrates agents delegating tasks recursively to handle massive context windows through hierarchical decomposition. [link](https://x.com/PrabhhavSharma/status/2020521817468002785)

## Research & Papers
- **Majority Voting in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Explained**: Post-hoc analysis shows why multiple weaker models voting outperforms single strong model; provides framework for extending principle to other domains. [link](https://x.com/HyeonggyuC/status/2020527765217218964)

- **Disfluencies Make AI Vocal Agents Feel More Human**: LoRA fine-tuning trains models to produce natural hesitations, pauses, and "uh"/"um" fillers—controlled imperfections significantly boost perceived spontaneity without losing intelligibility.
