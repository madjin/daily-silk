Treat context like a budget and offload research to subagents to prevent performance degradation over long sessions. [link](https://x.com/agenzlabs/status/2009286244547875228)\n\n- **Memory Compression for RAG**: PISCO compresses 128-token chunks into 8 special embeddings (16x reduction) without supervision, enabling 4-5x faster inference and 4x larger batch sizes while maintaining answer quality.

Instead track time from idea to working feature, bugs per release, and confidence when touching unfamiliar code—where AI actually shines. [link](https://x.com/Han_Fang_/status/2009284723302953328)\n\n- **Verification Culture as Multiplier**: Teams with solid verification practices (automated + human-driven) treat AI as an accelerator; teams without feel chaos multipliers. The difference is *who* verifies *what* and *when*.

Demonstrates cross-domain generalization (editing transfers from image data) and compositional task generalization (unseen task combinations). [link](https://x.com/CongWei1230/status/2009293322553315722)\n\n- **Boltz PBC Launch**: Open-source AI models for protein and small-molecule design. Launched as Public Benefit Corporation with $28M seed; accessible via web platform for scientists without computational expertise. Partnership with Pfizer announced. [link](https://x.com/HannesStaerk/status/2009280331442958814)\n\n- **Qwen3-VL-Embedding & Qwen3-VL-Reranker**: New multimodal retrieval and cross-modal ranking capabilities advancing state-of-art. [link](https://x.com/YichuanM/status/2009288097083646139)\n\n- **GRPO Fine-tuning on T4 GPUs**: Memory-optimized GRPO reduces 7B model VRAM usage to 9.2GB (~7x reduction), making large model fine-tuning accessible on consumer hardware via free Colab. [link](https://x.com/SergioPaniego/status/2009286675743015411)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Epiplexity vs Entropy**: New framework rethinking information theory for computationally bounded intelligence. Suggests current complexity measures miss what matters for practical AI systems. [link](https://x.com/m_finzi/status/2008934727156453661)\n\n- **Hyperparameter Transfer Mechanisms**: When and why hyperparameter transfer works in practice. Includes conjecture backed by extensive experiments explaining fast transfer phenomena. [link](https://x.com/albertobietti/status/2009288467721695439)\n\n- **LLM Book Memorization at Scale**: Production LLMs leak near-exact book text; Claude 3.7 Sonnet hits 95.8%. Raises serious questions about training data and evaluation. [link](https://x.com/adarshmathew92/status/2009286336360906923)\n\n## Industry News\n- **Infosys Partners with Cognition AI**: Major outsourcing firm backing AI software engineers signals shift in enterprise AI deployment strategy. [link](https://x.com/HarveenChadha/status/2009118767977259078)\n\n- **Tailwind CSS Downsizing**: 75% staff reduction tied to AI agents generating CSS, illustrating real disruption to template-based business models. The real issue: when you have an interpolation machine, selling templates becomes unviable. [link](https://x.com/ByteMohit/status/2009289773853057051)\n\n- **Memory Infrastructure Thesis**: HBM/DRAM/Flash constraints are the real bottleneck, not chips. Major cloud providers asking Micron for open-ended orders at any price—supply crisis beyond 2026. [link](https://x.com/demian_ai/status/2009284788012699819)\n\n---\n*Curated from 600+ tweets*"
