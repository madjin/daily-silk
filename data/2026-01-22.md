## Tips & Techniques
- **Claude Code Best Practices**: MCP servers unlock Claude's blind spots—give it browser control, Notion access, or file workspace management with one command. Setup varies by tool but enables agent autonomy beyond isolated files. [link](https://x.com/KKoppenhaver/status/2014363688439079307)

- **Workflow Over Prompting**: Orchestration and structured execution loops beat clever prompts. Design agent boundaries intentionally and use recursive loops to extend reasoning past single-pass limitations. [link](https://x.com/a1zhang/status/2014364653095116850)

- **AI Coding Workflow Reality**: Designer/PM should vibe-code prototypes in Cursor first—developers then review and iterate. Parallel agent work creates better codebases than sequential handoffs. [link](https://x.com/praj_22/status/2014366836041851035)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Localsandbox by Coplane**: Lightweight library giving agents sandboxed filesystem with safe bash and code execution. Built on Turso's AgentFS and Vercel's just-bash—enables agents to operate safely in isolated environments. [link](https://x.com/vimota/status/2014003591439069445)

- **Browser Use CLI + Skill**: 100% open-source tool gives Claude Code/agents browser control. Perfect for local dev—agents can navigate, interact with UIs, and return structured data. [link](https://x.com/kargarisaac/status/2014366069427725221)

- **Qwen3-TTS**: Open-sourced full family (VoiceDesign, CustomVoice, Base) with 5 models (0.6B & 1.8B), 10 languages, SOTA 12Hz tokenizer for extreme audio compression, and full fine-tuning support. [link](https://x.com/Tu7uruu/status/2014360823997538369)

- **GitHub Copilot SDK**: Production-tested agentic runtime for any app—multi-model, multi-step planning, tools, MCP integration, auth, streaming. Embeds same infrastructure as Copilot CLI. [link](https://x.com/satyanadella/status/2014360953111060894)

- **Pencil for Claude Code**: Infinite design canvas with superfast WebGL, fully editable, running parallel design agents. Designs live in git repo as json-based .pen format—converts designs to code directly. [link](https://x.com/tomkrcha/status/2014028990810300498)

- **VibeTensor**: First deep learning system fully generated by AI agent (0 human-written code). Working system with RCU dispatcher, cache allocator, reverse-mode autograd. 13 kernel types, 47k LOC Triton/CuteDSL. Shows what agent-generated code can achieve (and its current limits).

## Research & Papers
- **KAPSO Framework**: Knowledge-grounded Autonomous Program Synthesis—hit #1 on MLE-Bench and ALE-Bench among open-source systems. Ideate → Edit → Run → Evaluate → Learn loop. Launching Leeroopedia ("best practices" wiki built by AI for AI). [link](https://x.com/alireza_mshi/status/2014361653505139028)

- **NeurIPS 2025 Hallucination Audit**: Over 50 papers published at NeurIPS contain AI hallucinations in citations. Researchers aren't checking references carefully; some depend entirely on AI-generated content. Critical signal about peer review breakdown. [link](https://x.com/alexcdot/status/2014361871101669783)

## Industry News
- **Anthropic Gigawatt Datacenter**: Still on track to be first to operational 1GW datacenter online—massive infrastructure play for training next-generation models. [link](https://x.com/Jsevillamol/status/2013590199104655854)

- **Meta's Superintelligence Lab Delivers**: Bosworth calls internal base models "very good." Debate ongoing about open-sourcing. First H1 2026 release planned—signals acceleration in frontier model competition. [link](https://x.com/morqon/status/2013974872766964100)

- **Tesla FSD Europe Approval Expected**: Elon at Davos: "We hope to have FSD approved in Europe next month." Regulatory momentum shifting faster than expected for autonomous driving. [link](https://x.com/mitchdeg/status/2014366180438429900)
