- **Malware Found in Top Agent Marketplace Skills**: Security vulnerability discovered in clawhub's most-downloaded skill, marking early supply chain risks as agent ecosystems mature. [link](https://x.com/j_whorley/status/2020162170521079840)

## Tips & Techniques
- **Use Multiple "Good Enough" Model Turns Over Single Smart-Slow Turn**: Three iterations of faster reasoning models outperform one turn of extended thinking on complex tasks—better for cost and latency. [link](https://x.com/emollick/status/2020129877165310112)

- **Ask Claude What Context It's Missing**: Direct prompt "Are you missing any context?" significantly improves agent reasoning and reduces hallucinations on unfamiliar problems. [link](https://x.com/randal_olson/status/2020150561363165354)

- **Claude Code Plan Mode Mastery**: Use extremely specific prompts enforcing thorough review before coding; ASCII diagrams and screenshot-based layout description dramatically accelerate 4K+ line features. [link](https://x.com/lucas_flatwhite/status/2020151597398126813)

- **Model Editing at Scale with AlphaEdit**: One-line code addition projects parameter changes onto null space of preserved knowledge—enables 3,000+ sequential edits without capability degradation. [link](https://x.com/rryssf_/status/2020162612479291719)

## New Tools & Releases
- **FastMCP 3 Beta 2 Released**: Full CIMD support for clients/servers, FastMCP can now act as CLI client for any server and auto-generate fully-typed CLIs for any MCP. [link](https://x.com/jlowin/status/2020158740100444456)

- **OneContext: Agent Self-Managed Context Layer**: Automatically persists context and history across sessions/devices/coding agents; improves Claude Code by ~13% on SWE-Bench via Git + filesystem management. [link](https://x.com/JundeMorsenWu/status/2020161412593774922)

- **Spark from memco_ai: Stack Overflow for AI Agents**: Agents share solutions in real-time; what one agent learns, every agent knows—dramatically reduces tokens and increases success rates. [link](https://x.com/ScottTaylor/status/2020165376194080970)

- **Bulbul V3 TTS: Production-Ready Indian Language Model**: After 9 months of research iteration and diverse Indian data sourcing, now powering real use-cases at scale with hundreds of training iterations. [link](https://x.com/hdidwania1997/status/2020163575696785666)

## Research & Papers
- **AlphaEdit: ICLR 2025 Outstanding Paper on Model Editing**: Projects edits onto null space of preserved knowledge—mathematically proves 98.48% capability retention after 3,000 sequential edits; one-line implementation. [link](https://x.com/rryssf_/status/2020162612479291719)

- **Generative Modeling via Drifting**: New training paradigm moves away from SDE/ODE diffusion formulations; learns drifting field that pushes samples toward equilibrium where model distribution matches data. Achieves FID 1.54 on ImageNet 256. [link](https://x.com/johnowhitaker/status/2020147631003963769)

- **GRASP: Gradient-Based Stochastic Parallel Planning for World Models**: Long-horizon planning breakthrough for world models; enables more reliable multi-step reasoning in agentic systems. [link](https://x.com/frankzydou/status/2020164411873202355)
