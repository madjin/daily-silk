This directly improves both token efficiency and reasoning accuracy.

This compounds agent effectiveness.

Enables safe local agent development. [link](https://x.com/vimota/status/2014003591439069445)\n\n- **Mastra 1.0**: Open-source TypeScript framework for building AI agents hits stable release with 300K+ weekly npm downloads. Used in production for 7+ months by early adopters. [link](https://x.com/abhiaiyer/status/2014002842256978373)\n\n- **FastMCP 3.0**: Major architectural redesign of the MCP framework supporting nested protocols and improved performance for agent orchestration. [link](https://x.com/42bhargav/status/2014005083047162128)\n\n- **Google's Stitch MCP Server**: Google released its own MCP server for Stitch, allowing coding agents to generate UI designs on the fly and fetch code directly—turning agents into UI-savvy collaborators. [link](https://x.com/testingcatalog/status/2013995930702540980)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Self-Improving Multi-Agent Loops (MCP-SIM)**: Physics-aware simulation framework where specialized agents collaborate through memory coordination. On 12-task benchmark: solved all 12 tasks vs. GPT baseline's 6, with interpretable multilingual explanations. [link](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/2013998285040836662)\n\n- **NeurIPS 2025 Hallucination Audit**: 50+ papers accepted with AI-generated hallucinations from researchers at GoogleDeepMind, Meta, MIT, Cambridge. Detection tool now available to help conference organizers screen for slop. [link](https://x.com/alexcdot/status/2014001812127309951)\n\n## Industry News\n- **Software Engineering Will Be Automatable in 12 Months**: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei stated engineers inside Anthropic are already \"not writing code anymore\"—Claude Code writes, they edit. Predicts complete end-to-end automation within 6-12 months. [link](https://x.com/AIRoboticsInt/status/2014001397050552807)\n\n- **Lemonade + Tesla FSD Insurance Integration**: U.S. insurer Lemonade offering 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when Full Self-Driving is activated. Signals insurance industry treating AI-driven safety as actuarial fact, not speculation. [link](https://x.com/leslieasheppard/status/2014001433599766799)\n\n- **India's AI Strategy Over Model Scale**: India's IT Minister positioned India not as a model builder, but as the ROI layer—focusing on 20-50B parameter models, application-layer dominance, and deployment efficiency. Strategy: own diffusion and deployment, not raw parameters. [link](https://x.com/nikunjness/status/2014004973298995490)\n\n---\n*Curated from 1,200+ tweets across tech and AI communities*"
