After ~10 browser interactions, state balloons to 500KB, causing coherence loss. Ephemeral messages solve this by pruning stale data while preserving task memory.

Different formats unlock different reasoning capabilities in LLMs. [link](https://x.com/_juliettech/status/2012179108415918539)\n\n- **Give LLMs a Verification Loop**: Single most effective piece of advice—let the LLM verify its own work and turn that verification into a flywheel for improvement. [link](https://x.com/Infoxicador/status/2012167750018322531)\n\n- **Project-Based Learning Beats Roadmaps for AI**: Stop asking \"what should I learn?\" and start asking \"what do I want to build?\" Projects force active learning, your problems tell you what to study, and you ship something by year's end instead of finishing endless modules. [link](https://x.com/pauliusztin_/status/2012156868563542025)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **TranslateGemma**: Google DeepMind released a new family of open translation models supporting 55 languages. Available in multiple sizes, extends global model accessibility beyond English-centric tools. [link](https://x.com/clmt/status/2012186341032054798)\n\n- **Astro Joins Cloudflare**: The web framework behind Webflow and Wix is now owned by Cloudflare. Astro remains open-source (MIT license) and continues evolving with major cloud infrastructure backing. [link](https://x.com/pa1ar/status/2012184635955204470)\n\n- **Crystal Video Upscaler Improvements**: Can now handle longer videos—4K up to 43s, 1080p to 2:50min, 720p to 6:40min. Single upscale never runs longer than one hour. Fixes all prior bugs post-launch. [link](https://x.com/philz1337x/status/2012193228993569154)\n\n- **1Code: Open-Source Cursor-Like UI for Claude Code**: Launching on Product Hunt. Brings Claude Code's interface patterns to open-source, reducing vendor lock-in for coding agents. [link](https://x.com/serafimcloud/status/2012186190523589058)\n\n- **Replit Adds Mobile App Deployment**: Build in Replit, submit directly to the App Store. Removes friction between development and distribution for mobile developers. [link](https://x.com/MannyBernabe/status/2012168619346501700)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Job Skill Distances Matter More Than Job Loss**: Research in Nature Communications reveals lower-skilled occupations face far more radical skill transformations than STEM roles. A food production worker learning databases faces a larger cognitive leap than a programmer learning a new language. Reskilling support should target workers with the steepest \"skill space\" distances, disproportionately affecting women, minorities, and rural/small-business workers. [link](https://x.com/profjamesevans/status/2012187571888202133)\n\n- **Recursive Language Models Extend Context Beyond Limits**: Models now treat entire prompts as external data and write code to inspect it on demand. Extends effective context far beyond nominal limits (e.g., beyond 400k for GPT-5.2). Engineering details still early, but conceptually elegant. [link](https://x.com/guitchounts/status/2012185624145768514)\n\n- **MMLU Benchmark Severely Leaks Target Information**: Answer length predicts correctness (longest answer often right). Leading whitespace and other artifacts are predictive. LLMs exploit this leaked signal. MMLU rankings may still hold, but absolute performance estimates are unreliable.

    "description": "## Industry News\n- **ARC-AGI-3 Launching March with SF Roadshow**: Greg Kamradt's benchmark for artificial reasoning is getting a major update. In-person roadshows to show sneak peeks and discuss intelligence measurement with teams. [link](https://x.com/GregKamradt/status/2011996518447042611)\n\n- **AI Agent Security Crisis Emerging**: GreyNoise tracked 91K+ attack sessions across 73 LLM endpoints in 3 months. Every major model family targeted. Okta research: 91% deploy AI agents but only 10% have governance strategy. Identity & authentication are the new frontier. [link](https://x.com/thealexbanks/status/2012171071928029645)\n\n- **Protocol-Led Growth Replacing Product-Led Growth**: As coding agents autonomously choose tools, humans stop being the decision-makers. Marketing target shifts from developers using libraries to assistants selecting tools. Companies winning will be those with best agent-compatibility, not best UX.
