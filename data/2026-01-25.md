## Tips & Techniques
- **Claude Code Context Optimization**: Token efficiency is critical—vibe coding burns through tokens quickly. Filter context carefully and link to third-party files rather than embedding everything, as LLM accuracy degrades with larger context windows.

- **Chain-of-Thought for Complex Reasoning**: Force models to show their work before answering—add "think step by step" to prompts. For production, decompose tasks into explicit stages (plan → solve → verify) and orchestrate with code rather than relying on frameworks. [link](https://x.com/ndemir/status/2015443549920121232)

- **Agent Scaffolding Matters More Than Raw Model Capability**: How you structure agentic tasks often outweighs which model you use. Well-designed scaffolding unlocks better performance from smaller or less capable models. [link](https://x.com/Sapana_007/status/2015438225175711901)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Context7 Skill Filtering**: Reduced from 24k to 12k high-quality skills by filtering out duplicates, low-quality, and prompt-injection candidates using a specialized classifier. Demonstrates that more skills ≠ better performance. [link](https://x.com/enesakar/status/2015094043148243229)

- **Tendrill AI**: Proactive agent for personal finance accessible via SMS/iMessage. Fetches realtime market data, sets up recurring tasks, alerts on stock movements with reasoning, and performs deep company analysis—all free during early access. [link](https://x.com/dparksdev/status/2015450424199807113)

- **BaseScreenRecorder**: Open-source, 100% local browser-based screen recording alternative to Screen Studio. Free, no signup required—built to solve the performance issues of proprietary screen recording tools. [link](https://x.com/deifosv/status/2015451473963090330)

- **Komand**: Visual app builder with AI agents that can iterate and improve over 24+ hours. Deploy in 1-click and let the AI refine the UI automatically. [link](https://x.com/0xPaulius/status/2015205934801223910)

## Research & Papers
- **TTT-Discover: Test-Time Training for Scientific Discovery**: LLMs can adapt at inference time via reinforcement learning on specific test instances. Achieved SOTA on mathematics (Erdős minimum overlap), biology (single-cell denoising), and systems engineering (2× faster GPU kernels than human-optimized code). Uses modest compute (~$100s per run) with open models. [link](https://x.com/richardcsuwandi/status/2015452595809312963)

- **TeaRAG: 61% Token Reduction in Agentic RAG**: Hybrid retrieval combining semantic chunks + knowledge triplets, with intelligent filtering using Personalized PageRank. Achieved 4% improvement with 59-61% fewer tokens on benchmark tasks. [link](https://x.com/kuldeep_s_s/status/2015454095310827935)

- **GlobalRAG: Beyond Local to Corpus-Level Reasoning**: Exposes blind spot in standard RAG for global queries ("highest avg years across all docs"). Document-level retrieval + LLM filtering + symbolic aggregation tools achieve 340% improvement (6.63 vs 1.51 F1). [link](https://x.com/kuldeep_s_s/status/2015450063355699399)

## Industry News
- **ByteDance Diffusion Code Model (83+ Human Eval)**: 83+ score on human evaluation, trained on 1T+ tokens, MIT licensed, and reportedly 100× faster than alternatives. Demonstrates diffusion models as viable code generation approach. [link](https://x.com/darrenangle/status/2015450700226887937)

- **Anthropic Ships Before Microsoft 365 Copilot**: ClawdBot's rapid growth and functionality (proactive outreach, persistent memory, ecosystem of skills) highlights how smaller, focused teams can outship larger organizations building enterprise integrations.
