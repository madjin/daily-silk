## Tips & Techniques
- **Reverse-engineer design systems with AI**: Upload Dribbble videos or screenshots to Claude, extract the full branding kit (colors, typography, spacing, button styles, shadows), then paste into your vibe coding prompt for rapid UI generation.

- **Build agent playgrounds, not human-facing UIs**: Prioritize readable code, fast CI/linting, and good caching—these let agents move faster. Your job is creating environments agents love, not interfaces. [link](https://x.com/agcty_/status/2008410662398001255)

- **Read-only context for multi-agent orchestration**: Tell Claude Code "read all you need and stop just before editing files"—an effective pattern when running multiple agents in parallel. [link](https://x.com/PaulSolt/status/2008445024904900676)

- **Less complexity = faster AI iteration**: Simplified architectures let you ship and iterate faster with agentic systems. [link](https://x.com/PaulSolt/status/2008445192521593288)

## New Tools & Releases
- **LTX-2 (Open Source)**: First open-source foundation model for joint audio+video generation. Native 4K at 50 FPS, synchronized dialogue/SFX/music in one pass, runs on consumer GPUs with distilled LoRA versions for speed. Full fine-tuning support.

- **DFlash: 6.2x speculative decoding speedup**: Uses block diffusion for efficient parallel token drafting in LLM inference—2.5x faster than EAGLE-3. [link](https://x.com/kalyan_kpl/status/2008438062171517255)

- **ibtop: InfiniBand monitoring tool**: Now available on crates.io—simple install with `cargo install ibtop`. Essential for monitoring high-speed interconnects in AI clusters. [link](https://x.com/jannik_stra/status/1960633755841769981)

## Research & Papers
- **Agent harnesses are replacing bare agents**: Infrastructure wrapping agents (like Claude Code) will dominate 2026. The harness—not the model—is the competitive edge. [link](https://x.com/andrewthompsonx/status/2008445199446589539)

- **Why reasoning models loop**: Under greedy/low-temp decoding, reasoning LLMs get stuck in repetitive cycles. Research explains the mechanism behind observed behavior. [link](https://x.com/xennygrimmato_/status/2008427813695836664)

- **KV-Embedding: Training-free text embeddings**: Re-routes final token's KV states as prefix, enabling all tokens to access global context—no retraining needed for decoder-only LLMs. [link](https://x.com/_reachsumit/status/2008442764196016611)

## Industry News
- **ChatGPT traffic down 22% post-Gemini 3**: Dropped from 203M to 158M weekly visitors in 6 weeks; Gemini held flat at ~40% of ChatGPT's volume. Holiday slump or structural shift? [link](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2008380527141941420)

- **NVIDIA Vera Rubin: 10x lower inference costs vs Blackwell**: Shipping H2 2026 with 5x better energy efficiency, 4x fewer GPUs for MoE, 18x faster assembly. Mandatory liquid cooling (100% vs partial before). [link](https://x.com/techwith_ram/status/2008445824104362270)

- **Google DeepMind partners with Boston Dynamics on Gemini Robotics**: Combining DeepMind's vision models with Boston Dynamics' hardware/control expertise to advance embodied AI. [link](https://x.com/bousmalis/status/2008425257615388754)
