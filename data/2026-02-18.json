    "description": "# AI Digest - February 18, 2026\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Ask agents \"Are you missing any context?\"**: If an agent isn't doing what you want, this simple prompt can dramatically improve results by helping it identify gaps in understanding rather than guessing. [link](https://x.com/raphaelschaad/status/2023772787622768895)\n- **Canvas to Code over Code to Canvas**: Designers should use AI coding tools to directly manipulate production code via PRs, not just explore in sandboxes—tools like Figma MCP integration now enable this workflow. [link](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2024151242017296386)\n- **One PR per file for large refactors**: When running bulk code migrations with agents, open one PR per file so each can be reviewed and merged independently—no all-or-nothing bottleneck. [link](https://x.com/thdxr/status/2024147745024495794)\n- **CLIs over MCPs for context efficiency**: GitHub CLI, BigQuery CLI, and ffmpeg work better than MCP servers for most tasks—models already know how to use them, and they don't bloat context windows. [link](https://x.com/law_wu/status/2024144484796190837)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **Codex session portability coming**: Building toward starting a session on laptop and seamlessly resuming on cloud—harder than it sounds since agents aren't designed to pause mid-stream. [link](https://x.com/ibuildthecloud/status/2024129567116648733)\n- **Supermemory hooks for OpenClaw**: Makes OpenClaw memory 2x better by building knowledge graphs, using hooks instead of tools to inject context, and handling temporal knowledge with built-in forgetfulness. [link](https://x.com/supermemory/status/2023638057598021976)\n- **Screenpipe v482 ships pipe store**: Run scheduled agents on your local screen/audio data, now with accessibility data (10x less CPU than OCR) and improved pipe infrastructure. [link](https://x.com/screen_pipe/status/2024147596080460187)\n- **ElevenLabs voice agents now insurable**: First-of-its-kind coverage adds real risk accountability to AI voice agents, even for edge cases—treating them like human agents. [link](https://x.com/matiii/status/2024147154005012591)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Procedural pretraining beats web text warmup**: Warming up LLMs on formal languages and simple algorithms before web text speeds up pretraining on language, code, and math by establishing better priors. [link](https://x.com/DamienTeney/status/2024134226849771584)\n- **Superficial Alignment Hypothesis formalized**: New paper operationalizes SAH using compression theory—pre-training adds most knowledge, fine-tuning is primarily surface formatting (with caveats). [link](https://x.com/tvergarabrowne/status/2024140192982938102)\n- **Linear RNNs can learn state-tracking from code**: Study shows linear RNNs learn permutation tracking via next-token prediction on code, bridging theory and practice for state tracking. [link](https://x.com/julien_siems/status/2024145557468373245)\n- **MatGPTQ enables sliceable quantization**: Single model optimized across multiple bit-widths (Matryoshka GPTQ) with 3-5.6x kernel speedups when memory-bound—deploy same checkpoint across diverse hardware.
