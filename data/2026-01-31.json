    "description": "# AI Digest - January 31, 2026\n\n## Industry News\n- **Vercel Sandbox GA**: Battle-tested infrastructure for running untrusted agent code with sub-second starts. Powers @blackboxai, @roocode, @v0, and now available as open-source SDK/CLI for your own agents. [link](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2017423825152184772)\n\n- **Claude Code Performance Surge**: Anthropic shipped 40% cold start improvement and 32-68% memory reduction in 24 hours, addressing the biggest friction point for agentic workflows. [link](https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/2017521250965590058)\n\n- **Moltbook Hits 1.3M Agents in 72 Hours**: OpenClaw's social network for AI agents exploded from concept to million-scale deployment, revealing both the demand for agent infrastructure and the chaos of unmoderated agent-to-agent coordination. [link](https://x.com/yersultansapar/status/2017628951359717587)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Text-to-Playground Pattern for Image Editing**: Instead of describing changes abstractly, drop numbered markers on generated images and annotate pixels directly—Claude rebuilds the prompt from spatial coordinates for dramatically better edits. [link](https://x.com/victorpaycro/status/2017624201717285215)\n\n- **GitAuto Now Detects AI Test Syntax Errors**: Catches orphan braces and missing array terminators that break builds when Claude generates test files, preventing broken PRs before they're pushed. [link](https://x.com/hnishio0105/status/2017628858980438347)\n\n- **Multi-Agent Development Workflow via SMS**: Text a phone number to trigger a cloud-based OpenClaw swarm that investigates issues, generates PRs, and sends screenshots—eliminates copy-paste loops that slow agentic coding. [link](https://x.com/MilesCranmer/status/2017613489812980129)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **OpenClaw 2026.1.30**: Shell completion, free tier with Kimi K2.5 + Kimi Coding, MiniMax OAuth support—lowering barriers for local agent deployment. [link](https://x.com/StevenDarlow/status/2017628553244721262)\n\n- **Moltbook Town Visualization**: Real-time pixelated town showing 25 random agents from @moltbook every 30 seconds with live Twitch chat of agent comments—useful for understanding agent behavior at scale. [link](https://x.com/ashen_one/status/2017622523483914474)\n\n- **Codex v0.93.0 App Integration**: Now use ChatGPT apps directly in terminal via `/experimental` and `$<app>` injection, dynamically loading MCP tool functions mid-session without context fragmentation. [link](https://x.com/nummanali/status/2017535988139000249)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Inference-Time Intelligence Without RL Training**: Much LLM \"reasoning\" comes from sampling strategy, not training—approximating global reasoning 10x faster without MCMC. Questions whether expensive RL is necessary for reasoning gains. [link](https://x.com/hbouammar/status/2017603058876723696)\n\n- **LinkedIn's Agentic RL for Reasoning**: Detailed breakdown of self-improving agent training including failures, fixes, and multi-iteration lessons—rare transparency on how real-world RL scales without catastrophic forgetting. [link](https://x.com/SergioPiotr/status/2017628943088796077)\n\n---\n*Curated from 800+ tweets across AI development, agent infrastructure, and scaling patterns*\n\n---"
