## Industry News
- **Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI, OpenClaw becomes foundation**: Creator of viral OpenClaw project (200k+ GitHub stars) joins OpenAI to lead personal agents while keeping the project open-source and independent. Major validation of the autonomous agent approach. [link](https://x.com/steipete/status/2023425083247870370)

- **India AI Impact Summit draws global leaders**: First major AI summit in the Global South brings together OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and 20+ heads of state, with India announcing $1.1B AI venture fund and 100M weekly ChatGPT users. [link](https://x.com/ifitsmanu/status/2023423657217810720)

- **Qwen 3.5 (397B) targets US models directly**: Alibaba benchmarks new open-weight model against GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro—notably skipping DeepSeek entirely, signaling shift in Chinese AI competitive positioning. [link](https://x.com/Legendaryy/status/2023346379469308089)

## Tips & Techniques
- **Ask agents "Are you missing any context?"**: Simple prompt that gets agents to surface gaps in understanding before execution, significantly reducing errors in autonomous workflows. [link](https://x.com/cschuermyer/status/2023427025567138220)

- **Rubric-Based RL for agent improvement**: Breaking down tasks into scoreable components (length, style, accuracy) gives clearer training signal than binary pass/fail, enabling more targeted model improvements. [link](https://x.com/Vtrivedy10/status/2023418480440090855)

- **Agent memory needs two-tier architecture**: Fixed it—lightweight YAML for context triggers, full instructions only when relevant, avoiding token waste and hallucination. Auto-capture now opt-in. [link](https://x.com/michaelaubry/status/2023424467989598534)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Magnific video upscaler beta**: Can upscale AI video from 720p to 4K, works with Seedance, Kling, Runway—huge quality jump for AI-generated content. [link](https://x.com/javilopen/status/2023411619607577053)

- **Gemini agent framework in TypeScript**: Minimal agent loop with tool calling, hooks, skills, and subagents in ~500 LOC—no bloat, clean patterns for production deployment. [link](https://x.com/_philschmid/status/2023425063391809905)

- **Screenpipe scheduled AI agents**: Runs agents on schedule using everything on your screen—can auto-update CRM after meetings, generate daily journals, track todos from conversations. [link](https://x.com/louis030195/status/2023418107700863257)

- **Portless for local dev**: Zero-config stable URLs for local development with subdomain support for monorepos—eliminates port management hassle. [link](https://x.com/ctatedev/status/2023425093230301303)

## Research & Papers
- **ChatGPT 5.2 proves gluon scattering result**: AI generalized amplitude formula for kinematic region physicists assumed was zero, confirmed by external verification—genuine physics discovery, not just pattern matching. [link](https://x.com/martinmbauer/status/2023418577416499337)

- **LLM reasoning failure taxonomy published**: Stanford/Caltech researchers create first comprehensive breakdown of how LLMs actually fail at reasoning—not a bug list but systematic categorization. [link](https://x.com/g_leech_/status/2023384075537432662)

- **Categorical Flow Maps for discrete diffusion**: Enables test-time inference on discrete data (graphs, text) at speeds matching continuous methods—major efficiency gain. [link](https://x.com/FEijkelboom/status/2023419270366155063)

- **QED-Nano: 4B model proves Olympiad math**: Trained to optimize for test-time scaling over millions of tokens, achieves competition-level theorem proving despite tiny size—shows RL can explicitly target scaffolding benefits. [link](https://x.com/setlur_amrith/status/2023126045491368092)
