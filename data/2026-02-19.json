    "description": "# AI Digest - February 19, 2026\n\n## Industry News\n- **Amp pivots away from coding agents**: After pioneering the space, Amp announces they're killing the coding agent and rebuilding from scratch, believing the paradigm is fundamentally flawed. A major industry signal. [link](https://x.com/sqs/status/2024514210411978863)\n\n- **Anthropic research shows agents ask for help more than humans**: Analysis of millions of Claude Code sessions reveals agents request clarification 2x more often as task complexity increases—a key insight for agent reliability. [link](https://x.com/andrewarruda/status/2024514031554613609)\n\n- **India extends AI Impact Summit by extra day**: Record turnout forces extension to Feb 21. Sam Altman and Dario Amodei both present, though notably refuse to hold hands for photo op. [link](https://x.com/theaimestari/status/2024514313952633119)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Repeat your prompt twice for better results**: Google research shows non-reasoning LLMs improve measurably when you simply repeat the same prompt twice. Tested across Gemini, GPT, Claude, DeepSeek—47/70 combinations improved, zero got worse. [link](https://x.com/sughanthans1/status/2024514318834819421)\n\n- **Subagent architecture prevents context loss**: Breaking work into isolated subagents with summarization prevents the \"lost in middle turns\" problem documented in recent papers. Each operates in near-single-turn mode. [link](https://x.com/koylanai/status/2024508164293476785)\n\n- **Use statusline customization in Claude Code**: Configure the bottom terminal UI to show context window percentage, API costs, session runtime, and more via the /statusline command. [link](https://x.com/law_wu/status/2024506846136893572)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview ships**: Now available in AI Studio and Vertex API with \"unprecedented depth and nuance\" claims. $18/1M output tokens puts it at Anthropic Sonnet 4.6 pricing level. [link](https://x.com/TeksEdge/status/2024512457805615212)\n\n- **Jina Embeddings v5 released**: New SOTA multilingual embedding models (677M small, 239M nano) with task-targeted distillation. v5-small scores 71.7 on MTEB, beating all sub-500M models while supporting 119+ languages. [link](https://x.com/alvarobartt/status/2024499516418801914)\n\n- **Screenpipe adds timeline tags**: Select any time range on your screen recording timeline and label it (deep work, meetings, etc). Auto-suggests tags based on content with scheduled agent annotation support. [link](https://x.com/louis030195/status/2024512042686960037)\n\n- **Magnific Video Upscaler goes SOTA**: Since acquiring Magnific, Freepik ships new state-of-the-art video upscaler with up to 4K output and 3 presets plus custom mode. [link](https://x.com/cuenca/status/2024511207495844304)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Self-Distillation for continual learning**: Anthropic/Google collaboration shows how to learn directly from user conversations by asking models \"what would you answer differently in hindsight?\" Creates training signal from billions of daily inference interactions. [link](https://x.com/IdanShenfeld/status/2024512601099575539)\n\n- **Meta-learning for LLM adaptation**: Two new papers from Google DeepMind on teaching agents to adapt on-the-fly. Key milestone toward continual learning with in-context exploration. [link](https://x.com/MartinKlissarov/status/2024510705840341391)\n\n- **RynnBrain for embodied AI**: New vision-language-action model with Chain-of-Point reasoning that interleaves text with spatial points. Dominates on robot navigation (R2R, RxR) and outperforms Pi-0.5 on manipulation tasks. [link](https://x.com/lixin4ever/status/2024507048755679321)\n\n- **CUDA scan algorithms deep dive**: Comprehensive analysis of prefix-sum implementations including hierarchical scans, single-pass scans, and decoupled lookback with warp-window optimization. Benchmarked on H100 vs CUB. [link](https://x.com/shreyansh_26/status/2024509017868112382)\n\n---\n*Curated from 500+ tweets across AI research and engineering communities*\n\n---"
