- **GLM-5 launches with Agent Mode**: The new 200K context open-weight SOTA model introduces automatic task decomposition and orchestration, with benchmarks showing strong agentic coding performance. [link](https://x.com/Lentils80/status/2021971442431406092)

- **Minimax M2.5 official benchmarks released**: Achieves 80.2% on SWE-Bench Verified, 51.3% on Multi-SWE-Bench, and 76.3% on BrowseComp, positioning it as a strong coding-focused model. [link](https://x.com/Lentils80/status/2021971442431406092)

- **Cloudflare enables markdown for AI agents**: Websites using Cloudflare can now automatically convert HTML to markdown on-the-fly when AI systems request it, treating agents as first-class citizens. [link](https://x.com/gaganghotra_/status/2021973895436546226)

## Tips & Techniques
- **Let Codex ignore your plan and rebuild from scratch**: After failed refactoring following "best practices," telling Codex to ignore all previous work and use its own judgment led to massive speedups overnight. [link](https://x.com/tunguz/status/2021954569140334960)

- **Codex 5.3 excels at fixing GitHub CI issues**: Use the prompt "check why the latest CI run failed, fix it, then monitor the run. repeat until green" - Codex won't take shortcuts like deleting CI, it persists until actually fixed. [link](https://x.com/kr0der/status/2021948660762693902)

- **Edit format matters more than model choice**: One benchmark found a model went from 6.7% to 68.3% success just by changing how edits are expressed - the harness and context setup often matters more than the model itself. [link](https://x.com/Jasongbrown7/status/2021976773613769102)

- **Nanobot memory redesign: two files, zero dependencies**: Inspired by Claude Code's approach, reduced memory system to two text files (KNOWLEDGE.md + EVENTS.md) with grep search, cutting 73% of code while improving reliability. [link](https://x.com/xubinrencs/status/2021973509183090995)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Ramp Accounting Agent auto-codes 97% of transactions**: Perplexity achieves 97% auto-coding at the moment of spend, learning from corrections and auto-syncing low-risk items so finance teams focus on decisions not data entry. [link](https://x.com/geoffintech/status/2021973973991408015)

- **ColGREP and LateOn-Code models released**: Multi-vector code search tool built in Rust for coding agents, combining grep features with semantic retrieval, runs 100% locally with SOTA code retrieval models. [link](https://x.com/raphaelsrty/status/2021977277748166799)

- **Font Analyzer for web typography**: Easily analyze and extract typography from websites, detecting fonts, providing live previews, and suggesting free alternatives - useful for designers and developers. [link](https://x.com/lucas_flatwhite/status/2021949388298555810)

## Research & Papers
- **Beyond Mode Elicitation: Diversity-Preserving RL via Latent Diffusion**: New approach prevents solution collapse in RL fine-tuning through latent-space reasoning and diffusion-guided diversity, achieving +9.4% on code and +5.7% on math. [link](https://x.com/Lianhuiq/status/2021967360933158926)

- **How far tech determinism allows AI steering**: Analysis of nuclear proliferation, COVID vaccines, and PALs shows small changes in tech sequence can have massive consequences - we're in a critical window for AI development choices. [link](https://x.com/taoburr/status/2021974675992281139)
