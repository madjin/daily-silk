    "description": "# AI Digest - February 9, 2026\n\n## Industry News\n- **Quality Crisis in AI-Accelerated Development**: Teams shipping products at unprecedented speed are hitting garbage quality so fast that quality gatekeepers have \"zero shot at slowing things down.\" The gap between rapid shipping and maintainability is widening as AI removes traditional bottlenecks. [link](https://x.com/thdxr/status/2020511647723307330)\n\n- **Deployment Gap Costing Lives in Healthcare**: AI mammography detects 29% more cancers with 44% reduced workload, yet US adoption remains below 5%. Voice biomarkers detect Parkinson's 7 years early with zero commercial deployments—the real problem is implementation, not technology. [link](https://x.com/omar_or_ahmed/status/2020887861688435073)\n\n- **AI Industry Built on Book Piracy**: Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann testified downloading pirated libraries (LibGen, Books3) when founding the company; these same sources trained GPT-3/3.5 at OpenAI. Billions raised on models trained with pirated books. [link](https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/2020887580959518750)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Ask Your AI Agent What Context It's Missing**: When an agent isn't performing as expected, directly ask \"Are you missing any context?\" This simple question often surfaces blind spots and improves reasoning significantly. [link](https://x.com/ibuildthecloud/status/2020890013169557591)\n\n- **AI Agent Memory Architecture**: Memory is the filter of future behavior, not just storage. Design fractal memory across micro (messages/actions), meso (tasks/campaigns), and macro (roles/strategies) levels so agents learn what matters and adapt behavior accordingly. [link](https://x.com/RuslanVolkov25/status/2020886766518145261)\n\n- **Plan Before Coding Works Better with LLMs**: Give Claude Code planning time before execution. Plan mode without most tools often outperforms rushing to implementation—better reasoning leads to fewer revisions. [link](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2020888875745559029)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **Claude Code Shipping Chrome Extensions**: Claude Opus 4.6 now builds complete Chrome extensions with Shipper tool—creates multi-browser compatible extensions, handles Web Store listings, and generates privacy policies for ~$0.11/extension. [link](https://x.com/chhddavid/status/2020824310735339645)\n\n- **Seedance 2.0 Breaks Video Generation**: ByteDance's video model generates cinematic 1-minute scenes in 5 minutes with photorealistic quality. Every clip is 100% AI with no cameras—film industry implications are immediate. [link](https://x.com/kaynat_kakar/status/2020882056796872937)\n\n- **X API Skill for Claude Code**: Search X like the native Claude Code research agent. Query trending clawdbot skills, ticker sentiment, or topical discussion in real-time with time filtering. [link](https://x.com/frankdegods/status/2020363804014493920)\n\n- **Recursive Language Models (RLMs) Handle 10M+ Tokens**: RLMs force agents to explicitly reason about context vs. opaque state management, enabling multi-step reasoning at scale without prompt explosion.

    "description": "## Research & Papers\n- **Firelight: Dynamic Risk Oracles for DeFi**: Moving risk assessment from offline batches to online streams. Instead of static premiums, risk scores update every block based on live chain state (mempool, liquidity, volatility), turning risk into a broadcast signal that warns of protocol distress. [link](https://x.com/jrdothoughts/status/2020889669316018319)\n\n- **Debouncing in Agent Architecture**: Professor explains core CS principle of debouncing applied to OpenClaw—essential for grounding agent behavior in foundational concepts as hype cycles move fast. [link](https://x.com/ProfTomYeh/status/2020879138488250473)\n\n- **Transformers Learn Kepler's Laws, Not Newton's**: Transformers predict trajectories via Kepler's laws (orbits) rather than Newton's laws (forces). This fundamental difference in how models learn physics has implications for reasoning generalization.
