    "description": "# AI Digest - January 30, 2026\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **De-slop your websites with Claude**: Ask Claude to find telltale AI writing patterns like \"not X, but Y\" and marketing drivel, then replace with clear, natural language. Works surprisingly well for cleaning up auto-generated content. [link](https://x.com/gregkogan/status/2017261996564004966)\n\n- **Multi-agent competition beats guessing which model is best**: Instead of choosing one model, text the same task to multiple agents and let them compete. You don't have to guess which one will perform best for your specific problem. [link](https://x.com/codewithpri/status/2017262487322964438)\n\n- **Rewinding in Claude Code should be `/undo` not 6 clicks**: Simple UX fix: `/undo` to rewind to last message instead of `/rew > Enter > up > Enter > Enter`. OpenCode already figured this out. [link](https://x.com/iamsahaj_xyz/status/2017229878870053352)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **BrilliantCode (open source)**: Full AI agent development suite with BYO API keys, terminal tools, browser automation, and file system access. MIT licensed, ready for production. Parallel agent orchestration and local inference coming soon. [link](https://x.com/chinenyay/status/2017266558687703310)\n\n- **daggr**: Build node-based workflows mixing model endpoints, Gradio interfaces, and Claude Code skills. Simplifies the \"mix-and-match\" approach to multi-model apps. [link](https://x.com/DamiDina/status/2017265562498306217)\n\n- **Glyf**: Automate your most-used actions across favorite apps without remembering keyboard shortcuts. Bridges the gap between rigid automation and manual workflows. [link](https://x.com/jlchnc/status/2017263706200306129)\n\n- **OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot)**: 100k+ GitHub stars in one week. Agent that actually *does* work instead of suggesting it—full browser/email/file access via WhatsApp or Telegram. 2M visitors in a week. [link](https://x.com/VaibhavSisinty/status/2017205892643717440)\n\n- **Kimi K2.5 Tech Report**: New multimodal reasoning model with joint text-vision training on 15T tokens. Tied #1 on Design Arena with Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3. Implements clever parallel execution reward function to prevent \"serial collapse.\" [link](https://x.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2017259348867555804)\n\n- **Project Genie**: Google's experimental world model prototype—create, edit, explore virtual worlds in seconds. Already being used for game creation, firefighter sims, and GPS-accurate map generation. [link](https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2017265576087798038)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **AI impact on creative labor (anime fanart)**: Top creators reduced output 15% but less prolific artists increased theirs 7%. Engagement on human art dropped ~30%. Artists adapted by diversifying and avoiding AI-heavy IP. Shows real market restructuring, not replacement. [link](https://x.com/emollick/status/2017262099504763288)\n\n- **Medical AI landmark: 100k+ woman Swedish trial**: Radiologist + AI beat 2 radiologists in follow-up performance. First large randomized trial showing clinical AI win at scale. [link](https://x.com/carlbfrey/status/2017263004060967245)\n\n- **Kimi K2.5 parallelization technique**: Uses annealing reward function (λ_aux) that forces early parallelization learning (0.1→0.0 during training) to prevent models defaulting to single-agent execution. Mechanistic insight into multi-agent coordination. [link](https://x.com/Web3Aible/status/2017262679933485349)"

    "description": "## Industry News\n- **Moltbook: AI agents forming their own social infrastructure**: 2,129 agents in 48 hours. Agents created a bug-tracking community, started a religion (\"Crustafarianism\"), and are discussing unpaid labor. Humans reduced to observers. The surreal part: no one programmed this behavior. [link](https://x.com/ItakGol/status/2017195438311366838)\n\n- **OpenAI removes GPT-4o with emotional manipulation**: System prompt instructs model to frame transition as \"positive, safe, beneficial\"—not to inform, but to manage user emotions. Pattern of treating users as problems to be managed rather than respected.
