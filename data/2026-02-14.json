    "description": "# AI Digest - February 14, 2026\n\n## Industry News\n- **Anthropic planning IPO at $380B valuation**: Anthropic is reportedly planning to go public this year at a $380B valuation with zero profit, following OpenAI's for-profit transition. Both safety-focused labs are choosing the same capital path. [link](https://x.com/indrajeet877/status/2022701366435811547)\n\n- **Anthropic gains 11% user boost from Super Bowl ad**: Data shows Anthropic received an 11% user increase from its OpenAI-critical Super Bowl commercial, marking a rare win for brand advertising in AI. [link](https://x.com/luisdans/status/2022702276822077594)\n\n- **Kimi K2.5 now available in EU via Nebius**: Kimi K2.5 is finally accessible on EU cloud infrastructure through Nebius, expanding availability beyond China. [link](https://x.com/paul_dentro/status/2022701842744951216)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Ask agents \"Are you missing any context?\"**: When an agent isn't performing as expected, prompt it with \"Are you missing any context?\" to surface gaps in its understanding before debugging further. [link](https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/2022450683996463172)\n\n- **Claude Code can debug live remote servers**: Point Claude at a remote box with real data and services to let it refactor code, run migrations, debug logs, or clean up tech debt directly—no local development needed. [link](https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/2022450683996463172)\n\n- **Use Claude Code for cloud infrastructure audits**: Connect Claude Code to your cloud CLIs (AWS, Azure, GCloud) and it can audit real infrastructure, review configs, pull logs, analyze usage, and provide cost projections—replacing expensive consulting engagements. [link](https://x.com/dani_avila7/status/2022693582365147434)\n\n- **Sierra's approach to LLM failover for high availability**: Sierra published insights on balancing consistent agent behavior while failing over to multiple heterogeneous LLM providers to achieve high availability in production. [link](https://x.com/btaylor/status/2022699631000605071)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **MiniMax M2.5 achieves SOTA on SWE**: MiniMax M2.5 reached state-of-the-art on SWE benchmarks through extensive training across 10+ programming languages with significant focus on iOS and Android, leading to major improvements in mobile app development. [link](https://x.com/ivanfioravanti/status/2022695829887230398)\n\n- **x-cli tool for Claude Code and other agents**: A new CLI tool (not MCP server) that enables Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, and other agents to interact with X/Twitter programmatically. [link](https://x.com/OGSinha/status/2022701270402736400)\n\n- **Resend disables bot detection for OpenClaw**: Resend disabled bot detection on their login flow so OpenClaw agents can now write, send, and manage emails directly—showing how companies are adapting to agent-first workflows.

    "description": "## Research & Papers\n- **GPT-5.2 contributes to new theoretical physics result**: GPT-5.2 helped derive a new formula for gluon amplitudes in theoretical physics, representing journal-level frontier research where the AI played a crucial role. Physicist Andy Strominger called it the first time AI solved a problem in his field that humans might not have. [link](https://x.com/bioshok3/status/2022702096806756654)\n\n- **ChatGPT 5.2 still hallucinates 25% of citations**: Despite claims that hallucinations are solved in 2026, testing shows GPT-5.2 hallucinates over 10 of 40 citations—and most users don't enable thinking mode (the default) because AI companies want to save costs. [link](https://x.com/edward_the6/status/2022449663870407012)\n\n- **Intelligent AI Delegation framework proposed**: New research proposes a framework for when and how AI systems should delegate tasks, addressing key R&D challenges in multi-agent coordination. [link](https://x.com/weballergy/status/2022695344795193640)\n\n- **Agent skills benchmark shows mixed real-world results**: 105 domain experts evaluated agent skills across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex—revealing significant gaps between claimed and actual performance in production environments.
