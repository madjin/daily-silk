## Tips & Techniques

- **Model Quantization Post-Launch**: New models swap to quantized 8-bit versions after 21 days to reduce compute costs—plan accordingly if you need full capability. [link](https://x.com/cjzafir/status/2016534484792017202)

- **Trust Enables Speed in Teams**: Decision velocity depends on psychological safety. Leaders who don't require pitch decks for every technical decision compound better outcomes. [link](https://x.com/ndemir/status/2016540780920258687)

- **Skill-Based Model Distillation**: Use a large model to solve complex tasks, generate a Skill describing it, then teach small local models the same task—cuts tokens while maintaining capability. [link](https://x.com/pcuenq/status/2016537357428850951)

## New Tools & Releases

- **Kimi K2.5 Agent Swarm**: Open-source agentic model with vision, 256K context, and SOTA on agent benchmarks. Recognizes when tasks don't need parallelization and optimizes resource usage accordingly. [link](https://x.com/swyx/status/2016381014483075561)

- **E2B Sandbox Versioning**: Custom sandbox templates now support semantic versioning and environment-based tags (e.g., `my-app:v1.2.0`, `my-app:prod`). [link](https://x.com/mlejva/status/2016527434649137467)

- **NVIDIA FastGen**: Plug-and-play research library for few-step diffusion generation—consistency models, distribution matching, and long-video support. Open-source with Apache 2.0 license. [link](https://x.com/ArashVahdat/status/2016262430104682765)
