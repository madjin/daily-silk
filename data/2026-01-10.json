[link](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2009992296486617509)\n\n- **claude-mem Plugin**: Open-source Claude Code plugin that auto-captures sessions, compresses context with AI, and enables cross-session memory with vector + keyword search. [link](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2009995883321159882)\n\n- **OutRay**: Open-source ngrok alternative—expose dev servers to internet in seconds, fully browser-based, no installation required. [link](https://x.com/bolaabanjo/status/2010018751538970722)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **Stack: Foundation Model for In-Context Learning of Cellular Responses**: Arc Institute's new model lets you \"prompt\" cells like LLMs to simulate novel conditions without retraining. Handles disease states and drug responses directly. [link](https://x.com/yusufroohani/status/2010017952633159800)\n\n- **GPT-5.2 Solves Frontier Math**: First time an LLM independently solved an Erdős problem on its own (confirmed by Terence Tao). Shows frontier models now tackling problems at research frontiers. [link](https://x.com/KyleCranmer/status/2009995924979019950)\n\n## Industry News\n- **Anthropic Revenue Grows 10x Annually (3 years straight)**: CNBC profile reveals Anthropic's explosive trajectory and hints at major upcoming announcements. [link](https://x.com/xpasky/status/2010011301225844787)\n\n- **Boltz Lab + $28M Seed + Pfizer Partnership**: New AI-driven protein and small-molecule design agents launching with multi-year pharma collaboration. Public Benefit Corporation model prioritizes open science access. [link](https://x.com/GabriCorso/status/2009265928756760581)\n\n- **OpenAI MCP Server Live**: Ships with full OpenAI ecosystem integration, ChatGPT Apps support, and works out-of-box with Codex, Cursor, VSCode agents.
