## Tips & Techniques
- **Ask Your Agent What Context It's Missing**: If an agent isn't doing what you want, try prompting "Are you missing any context?" This simple question can reveal gaps the model didn't know to ask about. [link](https://x.com/ibuildthecloud/status/2021612761583612279)
- **Codex Desktop /fast Mode**: Fast mode in Codex desktop provides significantly better performance for rapid iteration, though users should monitor token spend carefully during intensive sessions. [link](https://x.com/danmana/status/2021611516546486664)
- **Agent Reasoning Should Be Captured in Git**: Store agent reasoning and session logs in branches agents can reference later, creating collaborative memory between human and AI work sessions. [link](https://x.com/davidpwalter/status/2021609253681733976)

## New Tools & Releases
- **GLM-5 Now Available**: Chinese model GLM-5 debuts on Zai platform with strong early performance indicators, potentially running as 745B parameter MoE on 3x 512GB Mac Ultras locally. [link](https://x.com/TeksEdge/status/2021614020692951275)
- **Qwen Image 2 Beats Nano Banana**: New 7B vision model (down from 20B) achieves higher Elo than competitors despite smaller parameter count, showing continued efficiency gains in multimodal models. [link](https://x.com/swyx/status/2021449840581099763)

## Research & Papers
- **Human-Centered Coding Agents Position Paper**: Research argues AI coding agents are over-optimized for solo autonomy instead of empowering human developers, calling for recalibration toward human-centered design. [link](https://x.com/ZhiruoW/status/2021603778982473813)
- **Vision Tokens Are Interpretable with Right Tools**: New "LatentLens" method shows vision encoder representations are highly intelligible in language despite never being trained on it, suggesting modalities converge on same representations. [link](https://x.com/benno_krojer/status/2021601162349199404)
- **Recursive Vision Transformers Work Surprisingly Well**: Experiments show 2-block recurrent transformer recovers 96% of DINOv2's accuracy, suggesting ViTs may be secretly operating as RNNs with depth-recurrence. [link](https://x.com/mozesjacobs/status/2021512823641542933)
- **ChatGPT 5.2 Pro Proves Open Math Conjecture**: Extended thinking mode ran for 66 minutes to prove a learning theory result that stumped all models for months, showing long-form reasoning breakthrough. [link](https://x.com/damekdavis/status/2021612697180074326)

## Community Highlights
- **Codex Overtaking Claude for Many Use Cases**: Multiple developers report switching from Claude Code to Codex for most tasks, with Claude reserved only when Codex gets stuck—which rarely happens now. [link](https://x.com/TreyGri30839938/status/2021614413795541163)
- **Matt Shumer's Viral AI Reality Check**: Article on AI's impact went unexpectedly viral with 4,297 likes, emphasizing importance of helping non-tech people understand coming changes. [link](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021442589258391587)
