## Tips & Techniques
- **Claude Code Planning First**: Before shipping, have Claude outline the architecture and iterate on the plan. This reduces rework and clarifies direction before code execution begins. [link](https://x.com/tobi/status/2009788652218695727)

- **Agent Memory Architecture**: Persist agent state across sessions using vector databases + relational storage. A single Oracle Always Free tier database eliminates amnesia and enables continuity across conversations. [link](https://x.com/arsh_goyal/status/2010012357142163636)

- **Reduce Reasoning Token Spend**: Ask Claude to think in Chinese (or any non-English language) during internal reasoning to save 20-40% on reasoning tokens without performance loss. [link](https://x.com/amplifiedamp/status/2009675570607775811)

- **Guardrails Enable Creativity**: Explicit output formats (JSON, tables, bullets) and defined constraints don't limit creativity—they free it by preventing the model from inventing scaffolding. [link](https://x.com/DumbEinstein/status/2010010500633973194)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Scribe V2**: ElevenLabs' new transcription model achieves SOTA word error rate, handles pauses naturally, and improves accuracy on accented speech. [link](https://x.com/TechAIideas/status/2010016930787406246)

- **Claude Delegator Plugin**: Use GPT-5.2 powered subagents directly within Claude Code via `/plugin install` and `/plugin add` commands for multi-model orchestration. [link](https://x.com/BjornHansenMMA/status/2010015207834456170)

- **Notion Skills for Claude**: Official Notion integration provides 4 pre-built skills—Meeting Intelligence, Research & Documentation, Knowledge Capture, and Spec to Implementation—accessible through natural language. [link](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2009992296486617509)

- **claude-mem Plugin**: Open-source Claude Code plugin that auto-captures sessions, compresses context with AI, and enables cross-session memory with vector + keyword search. [link](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2009995883321159882)

- **OutRay**: Open-source ngrok alternative—expose dev servers to internet in seconds, fully browser-based, no installation required. [link](https://x.com/bolaabanjo/status/2010018751538970722)

## Research & Papers
- **Stack: Foundation Model for In-Context Learning of Cellular Responses**: Arc Institute's new model lets you "prompt" cells like LLMs to simulate novel conditions without retraining. Handles disease states and drug responses directly. [link](https://x.com/yusufroohani/status/2010017952633159800)

- **GPT-5.2 Solves Frontier Math**: First time an LLM independently solved an Erdős problem on its own (confirmed by Terence Tao). Shows frontier models now tackling problems at research frontiers. [link](https://x.com/KyleCranmer/status/2009995924979019950)

## Industry News
