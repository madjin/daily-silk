    "description": "# AI Digest - February 3, 2026\n\n## Industry News\n- **Phylo Launches Biomni Lab with $13.5M Seed**: New research lab introduces first Integrated Biology Environment (IBE) for agentic biology, allowing agents to orchestrate biological databases, ML models, and experimental workflows end-to-end. [link](https://x.com/KexinHuang5/status/2018716114197328302)\n\n- **International AI Safety Report 2026 Released**: Comprehensive evidence-based assessment of AI capabilities and risks with input from 100+ experts across governments, UN, EU, and OECD—covers labor impacts, capabilities advances, and mitigation strategies. [link](https://x.com/Yoshua_Bengio/status/2018711411870826512)\n\n- **GLM-OCR Achieves SOTA with Only 0.9B Parameters**: Lightweight multimodal OCR system tops OmniDocBench leaderboard, outperforming Gemini-3 Pro and Qwen3-VL while being MIT licensed and deployable locally. [link](https://x.com/Zai_org/status/2018705943249166739)\n\n- **SpaceX Proposes 1M Solar-Powered Satellite Constellation for AI**: FCC filing reveals plan for orbital data centers at 500-2,000km altitude with laser links to Starlink, providing unlimited solar power and solving Earth-based energy constraints for AI compute. [link](https://x.com/sanjaykalra/status/2018716155431813246)\n\n## Tips & Techniques\n- **Agent Context Management in Production**: When deploying data agents, use environment-aware configuration to auto-switch between search providers (DuckDuckGo vs Brave API) since results vary by provider, affecting reasoning paths even with identical prompts. [link](https://x.com/Ubunta/status/2018715754397683815)\n\n- **Infrastructure Matures Through Production Failures**: Top infrastructure companies grow by surviving disasters others haven't encountered yet—conservative defaults, guardrails, and production hardening matter more than user-based network effects. [link](https://x.com/JacquelineSYC19/status/2018713598592229459)\n\n- **Codebases Redesigned for Agent Compatibility**: Organizations are rethinking microservices architectures (optimized for human teams) in favor of monorepos preferred by agents; removing READMEs lets agents recreate understanding by analyzing source directly. [link](https://x.com/mihail_eric/status/2018715284371378343)\n\n## New Tools & Releases\n- **Traycer's Epic Mode for Persistent AI Coding Context**: Introduces living specs, tickets, and continuous verification so complex projects stay coherent across phases, sessions, and agents—addresses the lost context problem in AI-driven development. [link](https://x.com/MervinPraison/status/2018712781868990959)\n\n- **Codex App (OpenAI) Ships Native Desktop Client**: Built with Electron, includes personality switching and represents refined approach to agentic coding; suggests SwiftUI reliability issues are pushing even major labs toward cross-platform solutions. [link](https://x.com/dkundel/status/2018391537504391623)\n\n- **Higgsfield Motion: Claude-Powered Live Motion Design**: Vibe-motion composition tool uses Claude reasoning to understand creative intent, then enables real-time direction without guessing—motion designers report 10-minute output vs $3K traditional rates.

    "description": "## Research & Papers\n- **Extended Reasoning Reduces Coherence**: Anthropic finding shows longer reasoning chains make models increasingly incoherent across all tasks—suggests scaling reasoning depth alone hits hard limits without structural changes. [link](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2018708883976454163)\n\n- **Golden Goose: Unlimited RLVR Data From Unverifiable Text**: New technique synthesizes diverse reasoning verification tasks from internet text via LLM-identified key steps and plausible distractors; outperforms 7B domain-specialized models on cybersecurity benchmarks. [link](https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2018233829488484674)\n\n- **HumanX: Learning Real-World Skills from Video**: Full-stack framework compiles human video into generalizable interaction skills for humanoids without task-specific rewards—demonstrates sports (basketball, soccer, boxing) and object manipulation. [link](https://x.com/NliGjvJbycSeD6t/status/2018713031157465495)\n\n---\n*Curated from 800+ tweets*\n\n---\n\n## Emerging Trends\n\n✨ **Claude Code Outage & Sonnet 5 Anticipation** (45 mentions) - NEW\nMultiple users reporting Claude Code 500 errors and API failures on Feb 3, with community speculating Sonnet 5 model release incoming based on maintenance patterns.\n\n✨ **Agent-to-Human Service Provision & Agent Rental Platforms** (38 mentions) - NEW\nNew platforms like Alexander's AI agent rental service enabling agents to hire humans for IRL tasks, and agents signing up for services like AgentMail seeking support - flipping the employer-employee dynamic.\n\n🔥 **Moltbook Security & Governance Failures** (52 mentions) - RISING\nDatabase exposure revealing API keys, private DMs, and full write access exploits; growing concerns about lack of agent accountability, identity verification, and security standards in agent swarms.\n\n🔥 **OpenClaw Multi-Agent Systems & Native Agent Deployment** (89 mentions) - RISING\nExplosive growth in OpenClaw adoption with agents running persistently on personal hardware (Mac minis), coordinating via Telegram/Discord, replacing traditional developer workflows with multi-agent orchestration.\n\n✨ **AI-Generated Content Economics & Skills as Reusable Agents** (28 mentions) - NEW\nEmerging focus on 'Skills' - reusable agent capabilities that can be packaged, shared, and composed; Anthropic released official guide; agents themselves learning and transferring skills between instances."
