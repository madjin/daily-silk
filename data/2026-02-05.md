## Industry News
- **Anthropic's Super Bowl Strategy Over OpenAI's Ad Model**: Anthropic spent millions on Super Bowl ads mocking OpenAI's plan to run ads in ChatGPT, positioning itself as the trusted choice while OpenAI moves toward monetization through advertising. This marks a shift in competition from pure capability to brand positioning and user trust. [link](https://x.com/yersultansapar/status/2019440886107529515)

- **OpenAI Launches Frontier: Enterprise AI Coworkers Platform**: OpenAI announced Frontier, a new platform for enterprises to build, deploy, and manage AI coworkers that operate across CRM, data, and internal tools with end-to-end task completion—using the Palantir playbook of embedded engineers for deployment. Early customers include HP, Intuit, Oracle, State Farm, and Uber. [link](https://x.com/kaynat_kakar/status/2019437921741287509)

- **Context Engineering Emerges as AI Moat**: With Manus hitting ~$2B exit and OpenAI building Kepler to operate across 600+ petabytes of data, the real competitive advantage in AI agents is shifting to context engineering—how models synthesize knowledge from many sources rather than just raw scale.

## Tips & Techniques
- **Prompt Caching is the Highest ROI LLM Optimization**: Prompt caching delivers the most value per engineering effort for LLM-based workflows and agents—enabling massive context reuse without regeneration costs. [link](https://x.com/TheChinthala/status/2019420715473367494)

- **The Interview Skill for Vibe Coding**: The `/interview` skill for Claude Code/Codex spawns subagents to explore your codebase, asks detailed questions, generates specs, and enables parallel agentic engineering (one agent interviewing, one reviewing specs, one implementing). Install via `npx skills add EnzeD/skills --skill interview`. [link](https://x.com/NicolasZu/status/2019416452550320626)

- **AI Orchestration is the New Literacy**: The ability to manage multiple AI agents, route tasks intelligently, and coordinate outputs is becoming the core skill—not just prompting individual models. [link](https://x.com/EB_XdotO/status/2019438724317344257)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Sarvam Vision: 3B State-Space VLM Achieves OCR SOTA**: Sarvam Vision, a 3-billion parameter state-space-based vision language model, achieved 84.3% accuracy on olmOCR-Bench, outperforming frontier models while being significantly smaller. Capable of image captioning, scene text recognition, chart interpretation, and table parsing. [link](https://x.com/HarveenChadha/status/2019433999106732336)

- **Swarms Framework v9.0.0: Unified GroupChat API**: Swarms consolidated InteractiveGroupChat into GroupChat, reducing API fragmentation with support for dynamic speaker functions, custom collaboration rules, and flexible output types for multi-agent orchestration. [link](https://x.com/jaenanft/status/2019433474978168878)

- **Truesight Ships Multimodal Eval Support**: Truesight now enables measuring AI quality across both image understanding and text generation simultaneously—critical for radiology AI, educational tools, and other multimodal systems. Measure coherence between modalities without coding. [link](https://x.com/randal_olson/status/2019430372078153836)

- **Kiro CLI v1.25.0: ACP & Enterprise Controls**: Kiro CLI added ACP support (use as agent in JetBrains/Zed), a clever `/help` command that reads actual docs and generates config files, proper CI/CD exit codes, and enterprise admin controls to kill web tools org-wide. [link](https://x.com/FlolightC/status/2019436033905955065)

## 2026-02-05 16:01:01

## Research & Papers
- **SIPDO: Closed-Loop Prompt Optimization via Synthetic Data Feedback**: ICLR 2026 acceptance shows prompt optimization is replaying 40 years of neural network parameter optimization in 3 years—moving from evolutionary search to textual gradients to closed-loop systems where synthetic data actively exposes prompt weaknesses. [link](https://x.com/HaohanWang/status/2019416171519348756)

- **BEAVER: Provably Bounding LLM Constraint Satisfaction**: First system to provide deterministic verification that LLMs won't leak data or generate unsafe code—not just benchmarks or estimates, but genuine bounds on constraint satisfaction. Critical for production deployment. [link](https://x.com/nalin_wadhwa/status/2019438361052868926)

- **daVinci-Agency: Chain-of-PRs Boosts Software Engineering Performance**: Research shows that maintaining global PR context (chain-of-PRs) substantially improves SWE agent performance and transfers well to real-world tool-use benchmarks beyond coding.
