## Tips & Techniques
- **Don't add file tree structure to agent markdown files**: Static file structures go stale and waste tokens. Agents discover file paths better autonomously than following pre-written trees. [link](https://x.com/MrAhmadAwais/status/2012915509046501608)

- **Use Leslie Lamport's structured proof style for AI reasoning**: Adding "Write a detailed explanation and a step-by-step proof presented in the style of Leslie Lamport's structured proofs" dramatically improves SOTA model proof quality. [link](https://x.com/nasqret/status/2012915436501823767)

- **Orchestration beats prompting**: The real frontier isn't better prompts—it's better systems for managing how agents interact and coordinate. [link](https://x.com/liadyosef/status/2012901321502843369)

## New Tools & Releases
- **Swarms API MCP Server**: TypeScript-based Model Context Protocol bridge connecting MCP-compatible platforms (Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, OpenAI Agents) to Swarms Cloud agent orchestration. Available via npm. [link](https://x.com/jaenanft/status/2012908499332989315)

- **GitAuto optimization round**: Pre-loads target files before agents start, runs bounded loops instead of phase cycling, explicitly signals completion. Fewer round trips, faster PRs. [link](https://x.com/hnishio0105/status/2012904094856364035)

- **LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct**: Most popular model on Hugging Face in 10 days; LFM2 family crossed 5M downloads. Competitive small model alternative. [link](https://x.com/jimmysmith1919/status/2012910334269706578)

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Free access via OpenCode + GitHub Copilot alongside Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4.1. [link](https://x.com/ekpodar/status/2012907111705928082)

## Research & Papers
- **MIT destroys context window limits**: 10M+ token prompts now possible by moving context outside the model. Practical breakthrough for long-document reasoning. [link](https://x.com/MatthewBerman/status/2012904491067048415)

- **AI solving hard math problems at scale**: GPT-5.2 Pro thinks continuously for 41+ minutes on Erdős problems with no special prompting and produces correct solutions. Multiple problems solved in January alone. [link](https://x.com/nasqret/status/2012907099089445158)

- **Brain's key-value storage mirrors Transformer architecture**: Neuroscience research shows human memory (hippocampus + neocortex split) converges on same design as attention mechanisms. Forgetting is search failure, not deletion. [link](https://x.com/ndemir/status/2012906834332467248)

## Industry News
- **Anthropic raises $1.5B+ led by GIC and Coatue, with Sequoia joining**: Major funding round signals confidence in scaling without massive proprietary infrastructure. [link](https://x.com/HerrGreenrush/status/2012916006000140795)

- **OpenAI launches ads in ChatGPT free and Go ($8/month)**: Monetization shift for lower tiers while protecting premium experience. [link](https://x.com/StudentGu/status/2012907230438305978)

- **Voice modes powered by weak models is the real miss**: Current AI voice assistants use "dumb models" with artificial disfluencies. A serious voice mode (Opus 4.5+ level) would unlock agent management capabilities. [link](https://x.com/emollick/status/2012901898337112314)
