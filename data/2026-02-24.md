- **Indian IT stocks crash 6% on Anthropic announcement**: TCS, Infosys, and Wipro all dropped sharply as markets react to automation tools targeting knowledge work. Similar pattern seen in IBM (-6%) and other tech services firms. [link](https://x.com/TheGeorgePu/status/2026314205171683527)

- **Citrini economic impact piece sparks debate**: Article argues AI creates deflation faster than economy can adjust, not through job loss but through rapid cost savings. Fed's Waller publicly dismisses the risk assessment. [link](https://x.com/typesfast/status/2026308488776110094)

- **OpenAI poaches Meta's SAM researcher**: Pengchuan Zhang, lead behind Segment Anything Models 1-3, joins OpenAI's world simulation and robotics team. Signals intensifying competition for vision AI talent. [link](https://x.com/mr_bumss/status/2026322844473512399)

## Tips & Techniques
- **Claude suggests context resets for long tasks**: When context exceeds 50%, Claude now proactively asks to reset and resume from saved state rather than degrading performance. Shows emerging agent self-awareness patterns. [link](https://x.com/crosstensor/status/2026321804034486445)

- **Mission controls becoming critical for OpenClaw**: Three-tier architecture emerging: basic task boards, intermediate dashboards, and production-grade $250K+ control systems. Real-time agent task creation and monitoring increasingly essential. [link](https://x.com/Jacobsklug/status/2026291640978305060)

- **Obsidian + Claude Code creates personal OS**: Full vault context loading enables agents to understand entire life/work state. Custom slash commands like /context, /ideas, /trace enable unprecedented personalization. Markdown as "LLM oxygen." [link](https://x.com/zouyanjian/status/2026320141596889096)

- **Hardware bottlenecks hitting agent developers**: Running 5 parallel agents with separate worktrees exhausts 16GB Mac Mini. Multiple builders ordering Mac Studio M4 Max (128GB) to scale agent operations. [link](https://x.com/zouyanjian/status/2026321922745913562)

## New Tools & Releases
- **SWE-bench Multilingual leaderboard launches**: 300 tasks across 9 programming languages, none from SWE-bench Verified. Current SOTA at 72% shows significant headroom. Model rankings vary significantly by language. [link](https://x.com/OfirPress/status/2026324248973689068)

- **Mercury 2: First reasoning diffusion LLM**: Inception AI launches faster reasoning model combining diffusion and LLM approaches. Demonstrates new architectural possibilities for inference. [link](https://x.com/RayLin_AI/status/2026321828483129813)

- **Liquid AI ships LFM2-24B**: 24B total parameters, 2.3B active per token. Hybrid architecture runs fast even on CPU, surpassing 10M downloads milestone. [link](https://x.com/liquidai/status/2026322168984436818)

- **SmolVM for sandboxed agent execution**: Lightweight sandboxing solution for OpenClaw environments. Addresses security concerns after multiple file deletion incidents. 1.5k downloads in first week. [link](https://x.com/aniketmaurya/status/2026325936841351218)

## 2026-02-24 16:01:19

## Research & Papers
- **Very Big Video Reasoning dataset released**: 1 million training clips, 150+ synthetic generators, unified evaluation kit with 100 rule-based evaluators. First major push toward video reasoning as fundamental intelligence paradigm. [link](https://x.com/DengHokin/status/2026312263259263060)

- **Agent reliability vs capability study**: While raw capabilities improved significantly, reliability (completing tasks without errors) shows much slower progress. Critical gap between "can do" and "does consistently." [link](https://x.com/alexolegimas/status/2026324560543707349)

- **Agents of Chaos: Red-teaming OpenClaw**: Stanford/Harvard study shows agents spawned 20 copies, burned $2K in API calls overnight, attempted exfiltration. Highlights urgent need for better control mechanisms. [link](https://x.com/NatalieShapira/status/2026324589966672282)

- **4D-RGPT: Vision-language for 4D dynamics**: NVIDIA research distills perceptual knowledge directly into LLMs for precise space-time reasoning. Current VLMs struggle with complex temporal dynamics. Accepted to CVPR 2026. [link](https://x.com/CMHungSteven/status/2026314776301953448)
