Cleaner than stuffing everything into prompts.

Maintain a markdown ledger of work as agent moves forward.

Mix random + active sampling to avoid distribution drift in production.

Generate artifacts quickly, get buy-in, then refine. Most designers waste credits chasing polish too early.

Solves the scaling problem for long-horizon agent reasoning.

[link](https://x.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2008923768056316001)\n\n- **NVIDIA Nemotron Speech ASR**: Open-source low-latency transcription model designed for real-time voice agents. Inference providers should have this live within weeks. [link](https://x.com/jaraujo_digital/status/2008924678870491618)\n\n- **Firecrawl**: Web scraping infrastructure for agents—handles complex layouts, JavaScript rendering, returns structured data. 109 likes suggests strong product-market fit. [link](https://x.com/oguzyagizkara/status/2008899846548185435)\n\n## Research & Papers\n- **AI Predicts 130 Diseases from One Night of Sleep**: Foundation model trained on sleep data achieves significant diagnostic accuracy. Nature Medicine publication signals credibility for AI in preventive medicine. [link](https://x.com/shivkuma_k/status/2008927120375091516)\n\n- **DeepSeek-R1 Paper Expanded 4x**: Updated preprint went from 22 to 86 pages with substantial technical detail. Signals serious engineering rigor behind the reasoning model breakthrough. [link](https://x.com/RainbowYuhui/status/2008929972204065132)\n\n## Industry News\n- **Model Providers Moving Up the Stack**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google founding Agentic AI Foundation to standardize agent orchestration. Traditional model providers now competing in application layer, not just APIs. Startups building on APIs face direct competition. [link](https://x.com/CobusGreylingZA/status/2008906490430546317)\n\n- **Code Review Turnaround Down 54% YoY**: Median code review time dropped from 2.4 to 1.1 hours (Jan–Nov 2025), with quality improving simultaneously. AI-assisted review catching issues faster, fewer back-and-forth cycles. [link](https://x.com/adambcohen93/status/2008927863475421250)\n\n- **Gemini Crosses 20% Market Share**: Similarweb Q1 2026 tracker shows Gemini surpassed 20% global AI website traffic share within 3 months of launch. Significant shift from ChatGPT's historical dominance. [link](https://x.com/mkovarski/status/2008922465586544666)\n\n---\n*Curated from 800+ tweets*"
